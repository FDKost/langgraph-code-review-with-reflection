# LangGraph Code Review with Reflection

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a simple code‑review agent using **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.  
The agent:

1. Generates an initial draft review of a code snippet.  
2. Reflects on the draft, scoring it on four criteria and producing a single verdict (`ok` or `needs_revision`).  
3. If the verdict is `needs_revision` and the maximum number of rounds has not been reached, it rewrites the review.  
4. The process repeats until the review is accepted or the maximum rounds are exhausted.

The agent is intentionally simple and can be extended with more sophisticated scoring or rewriting logic.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-code-review.git
cd langgraph-code-review

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the example environment file and add your OpenAI key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your key
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the demo on a sample function
python -m code_review.cli
```

The CLI will output:

```
Final review:
• Point 1
• Point 2
• Point 3

Verdict: needs_revision

Scores:
  pep8: 5
  type_hints: 6
  edge_cases: 4
  naming: 7

Weakest criterion: edge_cases
```

You can also feed your own code snippet by passing it as an argument:

```bash
python -m code_review.cli --code "def add(a, b): return a + b"
```

You can control the number of rewrite attempts with the `--max-rounds` flag:

```bash
python -m code_review.cli --max-rounds 3
```

## State Fields

The `CodeReviewState` TypedDict contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `code` | `str` | The source code to be reviewed. |
| `draft_review` | `str` | The current draft review text. |
| `criteria_scores` | `dict[str, int]` | Scores for each review criterion. |
| `weakest_criterion` | `str` | The criterion with the lowest score (used for rewriting). |
| `verdict` | `str` | The overall verdict of the review: `"ok"` or `"needs_revision"`. |
| `round` | `int` | The current round number (starting at 1). |
| `max_rounds` | `int` | The maximum number of rewrite attempts allowed. |

## Extending the Agent

- **Scoring**: Replace the simple threshold logic in `reflect_node` with a more advanced LLM prompt or a custom scoring function.  
- **Rewrite**: Modify the prompt in `rewrite_node` to target specific sections or to incorporate additional context.  
- **State**: Add more fields to `CodeReviewState` if you need to keep track of additional metadata.
